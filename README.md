# NeuralNetwork-JS-
This is an elementary neural network that can determine a positive emotion or a negative one.
This neural network is intended for beginners who want to learn machine learning but they do not have enough opportunity or information.

HOW TO WORK WITH THE PROJECT:
         when you click on C, everything is erased from CANVAS.
         when you click on V, you will train the neural network
         when you click on B, the neural network will try to guess
You have to train neural network, show to him what is POSITIVE and what is NEGATIVE
